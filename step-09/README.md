# Lab: Deploying a Website from Git Using Docker Built-in

## Objectives

- Create a backend service and a frontend service
- Build Docker images for both services
- Push the images to Docker Hub
- Deploy the application using Docker Compose
- Verify that all services can communicate with each other locally
- Deploy the application on a virtual host using Git and Docker built-in tools

## Lab Tasks

1. Develop a backend service (API)
2. Develop a frontend service (web application)
3. Build Docker images for the backend and frontend
4. Push the images to Docker Hub
5. Write a docker-compose.yml file that deploys:

- Backend service
- Frontend service
- Database service

6. Run the application locally using Docker Compose
7. Verify connectivity between frontend, backend, and database 8. Use Git to clone the source code on a virtual host
8. Deploy the application on the virtual host using Docker built-in tools

## Expected Outcome

- Docker images available on Docker Hub
- Services running successfully via Docker Compose
- Frontend can communicate with the backend
- Backend can connect to the database
- Application accessible and working on the virtual host
